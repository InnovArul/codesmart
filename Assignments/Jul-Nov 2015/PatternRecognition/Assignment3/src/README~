Assumption:
The dataset is placed under the directory ./data

to execute test for GMM & HMM:
-------------------------------

doallGMM(<number of clusters>, <dataset type>)

dataset type:

1: image dataset
2: Handwritten characters data set
3: spiral dataset
4: digit dataset
5: video dataset

to execute test for DTW:
----------------------------
